lazy-random - a fast random number generator.

lazy-random generates cryptographical strong pseudo-random numbers using
the ChaCha20 stream cipher. In order to provide some mild forward secrecy
we use the "fast key erasure" [1] technique every 64KiB and rekey
completely from /dev/urandom every 1GiB.

This program uses the crypto++-library (https://cryptopp.com). Thank you
guys. You're awesome!
